A fast food chain plans to add a new item to its menu. However, they are still undecided between three possible marketing campaigns for promoting the new product. In order to determine which promotion has the greatest effect on sales, the new item is introduced at locations in several randomly selected markets. A different promotion is used at each location, and the weekly sales of the new item are recorded for the first four weeks.

Our second major focus on 3 promotional strategies:

Collectibles - Fast food companies can drive sales through collectibles, particularly those that kids enjoy. For instance, a popular animated film, dolls, glasses or other mementos that are related to the movie. The owners decided to provide one free item for the purchase of the vegan patty burger. This fast food marketing strategies entices people to come back until they have all the collectibles.

Societal Marketing - It includes volunteering or collecting money or items for charity. Consumers who relate to our ideas and values due to our charitable work may, in turn, patronize our fast food restaurant.

Loyalty Programs - Frequency card programs are a popular type of loyalty program for fast food restaurants. The owners plan to invite people to fill out an application and reward them according to the frequency in which they order the particular product. They planned on giving a free drink after their first four orders, then free fries after their next four orders. Ultimately, a customer could earn a free meal after 12 orders.
